# Equip Receiver
A simple overlay that can receive [Item Slot](item_slot.md) drag and drop and assign to the appropriate [Equip Slot](equip_slot.md).

## Simple Usage
Attach the component to any GameObject with a raycastable graphic.

Assing the **Slots Container** property to the **Transform** that contains the equip slots.

Optionally you can have a hint text that will only be visible when you are dragging a suitable slot over the overlay.
